This is a work in progress to determine if a serverless Shiny app with webR as described by [Veerle van Leemput](https://hypebright.nl/index.php/en/author/veerlevanleemputlive-nl/) is appropriate for an application that is heavier in data. 

I have chosen to refactor this (see below) dashboard there were some issues with rendering of percentages additionally the data pre-processing was refactored to be somewhat more compliant with tidyverse principles, the rest of the changes are aesthetic in nature.

If the application turns out to be too heavy this will remain as a derivative example/template dashboard based on Margaret Sant's original app.

Here you can see the [Customer churn dashboard](https://kdqs0y-jay-gamboa.shinyapps.io/telecommunications-customer-attrition-dashboard-master/)
